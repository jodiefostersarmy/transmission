[Portfolio Website]()

### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to showcase and catalogue my work from over the years, while also providing a point of contact for people interested in working with me. I plan to do this through a design that translates my ethos to the overall feeling, providing a good framework for it to be built upon and upgraded.

As my learning progresses, the website will reflect the tools I pick up along the way, so it will also be continually upgraded and implemented with new changes and features.

### Functionality / Features
I wanted to keep the functionality simple, concise and understated. I also wanted it to be able to load across all browsers with a high level of consistency, so that the user experience would not change dramatically for browsers or device, but the style would alter slightly for additional personality.

*Note: The show and hide functionality for the images in the grid and the buttons on the mobile breakpoint in the "Blog" section of the website have not yet been implemented, but as the wireframes below in the screenshot will outline the intended outcome will be in the future, once I have learnt some Javascript.*

*Note: Also, the "Contact" page contains a form that submits to nowhere as I do not yet have the knowledge of Javascript and its libraries. This will be updated and functioning in the future.*

**N.B. Due to a glitch in Ed, my workspace malfunctioned, so I deleted the folder that contained my old files and moved them to newly created folder. In the process I accidentally deleted all my git commits within the old folder. I was committing every change, so I've hit the point of no return with the new git.**
